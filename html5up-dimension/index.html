								<h2 class="major">Goals</h2>
								<p>As a computer engineering student at Georgia Tech, I have many future goals that I plan to achieve. Some of them are related to my academic and professional development, while others are more personal and creative.</p>
								<p>One of my academic goals is to graduate with honors and a high GPA from Georgia Tech, which is one of the top-ranked engineering schools in the world. I want to excel in my courses and projects, and learn as much as I can from my professors and peers. I also want to participate in research and internships that will expose me to cutting-edge technologies and real-world problems in computer engineering.</p>		
								<p>Another academic goal is to pursue a master's degree or a PhD in computer engineering or a related field, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, or cybersecurity. I want to deepen my knowledge and skills in these areas, and contribute to the advancement of science and society. I also want to collaborate with other researchers and engineers from different backgrounds and disciplines, and expand my network and opportunities.</p>
								<p>One of my professional goals is to work for a leading company or organization that is innovating and making a positive impact in computer engineering or a related field. I want to apply my knowledge and skills to solve challenging and meaningful problems, and create products or services that will benefit people and the environment. I also want to grow as an engineer and a leader, and mentor others who share my passion and vision.</p>
								<p>Another professional goal is to start my own company or organization that is focused on computer engineering or a related field. I want to use my creativity and entrepreneurship to create something new and valuable, and make a difference in the world. I also want to inspire and empower others who have similar ideas and aspirations, and create a culture of innovation and excellence.</p>
								<p>One of my personal goals is to travel around the world and experience different cultures and lifestyles. I want to see the beauty and diversity of nature and humanity, and learn from them. I also want to make friends and connections with people from different countries and backgrounds, and share my stories and perspectives.</p>
								<p>As a human, my vision for the world and my future is always open to changing and I am always open to creating new ones, especially as I work to complete the ones that I already have. I hope this helped you learn a little bit more about me!</p>
								<p>(Don't forget to check out my <a href="#work">awesome projects to see how I'm working towards them!)</a>.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>For my project, my goal was to design a light that is able to turn on and off via sound. The utility of this centers around solving the inconviences of having to manually reach for the on button or a remote in order to turn on and change the color of lights.</p>
								<p>The first step of this process was determining what materials I would need in order to make this work. After some research on similar projects that have been completed online, I determined that I would need an Arduino or similar microcontroller, a SparkFun sound detector or similar audio sensor, a breadboard + jumper wires, an LED strip, a 9V battery, a 9V battery connector, an audio splitter, a resistor, and an NPN transistor.</p>
								<p>Next, I set up the circuit on the breadboard. I connected the positive end of the LED to the 9V power supply through the 330-ohm resistor, and the negative end to the ground. I added the NPN transistor to control when the LED turned on and off.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/board.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>After that, I wired the sound detector to the arduino and the RGB LED. The sound detector allows the LED to react to sound and sound intensity. This could then be customized based on what I wanted in the programming stage.</p>
								<p>I decided that I wanted to control the LED color based on the intensity of the sound. I used code from the SparkFun website as a starting point and modified it as needed. This part took the longest as the data from the microphone wasn't clean or consistent so it was hard to get a reliable color. To address this, I spent a few days learning about microphone algorithms that toned down static noise and random interference issues. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Base Code.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>Now that I had the internals functional to an extent, I began work on designing the enclosure. Using a combination of blender and solidworks, I was able to design a light saber that hid the components within the handle and lined the inside of the saber portion with the LEDs. I started with a test print of the handle to ensure that the components I was using would fit inside. </p>
								<p>Fortunately, double checking on the dimensions whilst CADing paid off and everything fit first try. The handle did end up being a little chunkier than I was expecting but it was nothing that would stop this project from being successful. Now that I had finished with the handle and placing the components inside, I got to work printing a draft of the saber portion itself. The sabers are a series of tubes that are slightly wider at the bottom so that when pushed through each other, they stop before coming out fully. </p>

								<p>Once everything was assembled, I tested out the sound activation. I intended for the saber sliding out of the handle to generate enough sound to activate the lights which would be a cool transition. Unfortunately, the algorithm that I used to limit static sounds from interfering with the microphone imputs were negating the sliding sound from passing the needed threshhold to activate the light. The light can still be activated by smacking the handle but even loud external noise sometimes doesn't trigger the light because the microphone sits within the handle which is solid. I plan to fix this by drilling a small hole for the microphone to be exposed to the raw sounds of its environment.  </p>
								<p>With that being said, a smack on the handle to activate the light isn't half bad and the light saber did turn out pretty well visually. I had some fun testing the light penetration of sabers with different colored filament. Check out some more photos of it featured below.</p>

								<p>As you've probably seen many times around this website, my name is Matthew, but that doesn't truly tell you who I am. I'm a student in the college of ECE at Georgia Tech. I enjoy doing camera work, photo/video editing, helping businesses, going to the gym, and training MMA. I strive for success so that I can help those around me reach their goals too. Around the world, there are so many places that struggle with the most basic needs. I believe by helping others around you, you help the world. </p>
